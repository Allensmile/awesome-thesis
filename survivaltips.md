# Surviving your CS master thesis: practical tips
This document is a collection of practical tips and suggestions to
help students (and their advisors) survive a master thesis.

## Help your advisor(s) help you
 + be *proactive*, things may slip through the cracks, look for 
 + don't be scared of challenging your advisor' assumptions ``we might try using this approach`` doesn't mean you shouldn't think of alternative approaches to solving a problem
 + if you seem to get stuck, look around, and ask for a meeting with your advisor(s)
 + don't wait for your advisors to tell you every single practical step ``use this technique x with parameter k=5, and 7``, experiment, if you are unsure wethere you should try an experiment or not, ask, *do not wait*
 + if a task seem too burdensome, don't be afraid to discuss the issue, you might come up with different and easier approaches to solving the problem at hand
 + keep notes in a shared document (for example google doc): literature searches, ideas and meetings "output"


## Guidelines for thesis output (i.e., code, data)
 + Backup and keep track of the data you produce: be sure to permanently store intermediate steps, if you have not enough storage ask your advisors don't delete a VM with experiments because you have no space left on your personal laptop!

### Code
 + For every repo/directory/different component, ensure always that experiments are easily reproducible if possible (i.e., generate scripts, and shortly document them) this will help your advisor(s) to quickly look at the code and possibly help you crack difficult problems in a quicker fashion
 + stick to a coding convention (e.g., Python PEP8, a C coding standard of your choice that fits your project...)

 + document your code where you can

### Data
 + If you are generating, retriving or using a dataset, be sure that the processes are reproducible (e.g., keep a README with the list of datasets, use scripts to automate generation/retrieval, etc.)
 + evaluate the consistency of your dataset
